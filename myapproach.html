        <h3 align=center>My approach</h3>
        <p>For both family as well as civil/commercial mediations, I adopt the 'shuttle' mediation approach.  After the introductory meeting, the parties go to separate rooms and my 
discussions with each party are private and confidential.  I then convey each party's proposals and other information to the other party, in accordance with my instructions.  The parties may be accompanied by their lawyers or a friend, if they wish.</P
<p>The mediation takes place in a single day.   The parties agree on the venue for the mediation and make the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>I charge a fee based on the number of hours I am involved in the process.  My hourly rate is £80 to £120 depending on the type and complexity of the case.  Usually the parties share the cost.  Typically, mediations last between 4 and 8 hours, plus 2 hours preparation time.</p>
